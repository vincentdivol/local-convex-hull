# Short tutorial for the article *Minimax adaptive estimation in manifold inference*

I propose a code to play around the concept of *local convex hull*, that is define in [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04896). In particular, the method described in the paper to select a ''good'' scale for the local convex hull is implemented.

- [utils.py](todo) contains auxiliary functions used in the notebooks below
- [create_samples.py](todo) contains different functions to sample according to different distributions on manifolds.
- [local_conv.ipynb](todo) is the tutorial 

The Jupyter Notebook can be lauched on Binder.
